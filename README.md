Ever wish you could bring more love to all those animals across your world? A lonely slime deserves some affection.. your dog needs more pets..

Well now,
## Pet the Frog has expanded to include all friendly animals!
You can pet dogs, cats, sheep, cows, sniffers, (small) slimes, and so many more!

Simply right click any animal and watch them send little hearts of affection

<summary>Note: Some interactions work slightly differently:</summary>
Certain animals have their own right click interactions that need to be preserved, and to do so, some animals are interacted with slightly differently:
  
- Striders, when they have a saddle on, can be crouch right-clicked to be petted
- Parrots must be crouch right-clicked, and if you hold down right-click while crouching you are able to pick up your parrot onto your shoulders just like before
- For Rideable horse-like mobs, you crouch right-click to pet them, and hold down crouch right-click to enter their saddle inventory.*
  - ***Required serverside for this functionality. otherwise the inventory will always open**
  - **This applies to Horses, Mules, Donkeys, Llamas, and Camels**
- Tamed dogs and cats can be pet simply by right clicking, and to toggle their sitting/standing status, you crouch right click.*
  - ***Required serverside for this functionality. if not present, the animals will toggle sitting/standing regardless of being pet**

Ever look at a frog and think, "hm, I wish I could squish those cheeks and make it croak..."

<b>Well now you can!</b>

Simply right clicking on any frog with an empty hand will let you pet those little slimy heads and make those boios croak and ribbit all night long!
